  <p>Renting a car is one of the best ways to explore an unknown place. Yet many of us dislike the idea due to safety reasons. How safe is it to drive in a new place without the knowledge of the local roads? Well, it is not always risky if you are an alert tourist.
</p>

<h3 style="color: #39A2DB;">Tips to Follow Before Renting a Car</h3></center>
<br>
<br>
<p>If you are planning to rent a car while touring the city, here is a brief guideline. Follow these tips to make your tour safe and stress-free.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">1. Know the Process</h4>
Before hiring, get the details about the policies of the car hire company. How the cost will be shared if the car meets some damage. Get the contact number of the responsible person to contact in the case of an emergency.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">2. Carry Essential Documents<br></h4>
Make sure you have your driving license with you. Also, check if the vehicle is insured. If possible, get a copy of the insurance paper.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">3. Expense Coverage<br></h4>
Check if your travel insurance provider is covering you for the rental car travel. If you have credit card travel coverage, check if it covers rental cars too.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">4. Check the Vehicle Before you Start<br></h4>
Check the car for proper door locks, windows, and wipers, and other basic functioning of the vehicle. Especially if you are going to drive in bad weather, be extra careful about checking the vehicle properly. Check the car with a quick spin to know the basic functions like braking, turning is smooth.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">5. Check Air Conditioning<br></h4>
Renting a car with proper air conditioner is important. This will allow you to drive with all the windows closed properly. Hence, always hire an air-conditioned car when you have to drive in remote and unknown roads. Being a foreigner or unfamiliar in the place makes you more vulnerable.
<br>
<br>
<h4 style="color: #39A2DB;">6. Consult for Directions and Routes<br></h4>
Setting out with a rental car in the unknown city might cost you a waste of time. Consult the owner for the best route you should take. An idea of the roadmap will help save you from taking wrong and unsafe roads. Also, consult the company if they know any nearby service stations in the vicinity.
<br>
<br>
<p>Besides the above precautions, choose a model you are comfortable driving. Avoid choosing a very luxurious and flashy car. You might attract burglars with your pricey car. It would be better if you do not draw unwanted attention in the unknown city.
